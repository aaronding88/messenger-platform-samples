# Facebook Bot Task

This is the codebase for the Facebook Joker Bot assignment.

This codebase was built thanks to a Facebook tutorial on Messaging Bots. Much of the code in the tutorial built the framework for operating
the bot.

## Installation
This is made to be run locally on the assignee's computer, through Express and Localtunnel. However, if this is to be installed, it requires
the following:
 1. Deploy this code to a server running Node.js
 2. Run `npm install`
 3. Run `npm install async`
 3. Update the VERIFY_TOKEN
 4. Add your PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN to your environment vars
